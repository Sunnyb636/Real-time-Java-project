step 1 - Cloned the java project from github using command "git clone <repo link>".
         
step 2 - Installed maven and build a source code using command "mvn verify". This will create executable war file which we have to deploy over tomcat webserver.
         
step 3 - A docker file is created which will pull tomcat image and deploy executable dile in desired location.
